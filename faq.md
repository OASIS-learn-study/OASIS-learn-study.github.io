## Free?

Humans volunteer, server machines do not.

At this time, we are running this hosted on a Red Hat employee account on Openshift.com Online.

We are currently thinking about how to pay for our hosting costs to you let play more.

Sponsorship discussions most welcome!


## Open Community

We are very open to welcome new contributors!  Configuration is code.  Minecraft worlds will (eventually) be in Git repos.


## Minecraft & Open Source

Minecraft is a commercial game originally by Mojang, now Microsoft.

This Minecraft server [runs on code from a lot of open source (FLOSS) projects](sources.md).

You need a valid Minecraft PC Java Edition single user license to play with us here.
